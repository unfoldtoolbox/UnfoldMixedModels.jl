In case of hierarchical structures (e.g. repeated trials in subjects, different stimuli used) the Linear Mixed Model has become very popular. Unfortunately, fitting such models can be quite involved, especially for EEG data which require massive-modelfitting for each sensor and channel. MixedModels.jl provides a fast way for fitting, and UnfoldMixedModels.jl provides the bookkeeping to do so in a massive way. Users can easily extract fixed and random effects over time and sensors, do statistical testing and even correction for multiple comparisons (via UnfoldStats.jl / MixedModelsPermutations.jl).","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"UnfoldMixedModels.jl Documentation","title":"UnfoldMixedModels.jl Documentation","text":"<!---\nNote: The statement of need is also used in the `README.md`.
